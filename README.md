Some old python scripts that follow weaving draft pragma to print out some nice patterns in the terminal.

There are some pre-designed patterns in _patterns.py_ that can be displayed with the _loomer.py_ script.

Example:
```zsh
python loomer.py p4 4 6
```

Where the arguments `p4`, `4`, and `6` refer to the pattern name, row, and column count, respectively.
